	<main><h1>Amazing Future Technology!</h1></main>
	<footer><p>It has been clear that technology has shaped the lives of humans in the current digital world. At the same time, technological innovation and advancement will also shape the future of our planet. By now, Iâ€™m certain you must have heard of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Two are the engines or the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution. In the future, they will bring about technological approaches that will largely affect how we do things.</p></footer>
	<br>
	<footer>Sadly, it is predicted that future technology will take over more than 50% of the total labor market. Computers and robots will take over the human workforce. It explains why we should emphasize embracing technology as we transition to the 4th industrial revolution.</footer>
	<br>
	<h2>Why Should We Embrace Technology?</h2>
	<footer>I can confidently say that without technology, life would be hard. In the current world, technology has made it easy for humans to perform simple and complex tasks. Sometimes I sit and wonder how people in the past lived without technology. The main reason we should embrace technology is that it has been incorporated in nearly all sectors of the world today. Future technology is predicted to be even more advance than today. Again, I wonder how technologically illiterate people will survive, especially in the labor market.</footer>
	<br>
	<h2>Recommendations</h2>
	<footer>The best recommendation is to push for technological empowerment, especially for the future generation, by introducing compulsory technological programs like coding and programming programs in the school curriculum. This will equip the young generation with the necessary technical skills that will be required in the future. At the same time, it will be a huge step towards embracing modern technology and focusing on its positive side rather than just the negative impacts.</footer>
	<br>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<footer>To sum all these up, it is appropriate to say that we are a lucky generation to have lived to witness the current technological evolution. As a result, we should be at the forefront of pushing for embracing modern forms of technology. We should also pursue the young generation to pursue technology-related careers to prepare them for the future. Failure to do so will make it hard to catch up with the complex future technology. </footer>
